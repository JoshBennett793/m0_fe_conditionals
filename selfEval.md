# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
I am pretty confident in my understanding and fluency with comparison operators.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
I am fairly confident in my understanding of logical operators. I'm less confident in my fluency with logical operators in more complex implementations but I understand the basic functionality of them.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
I feel very confident in my understanding and fluency with if statements.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
I spent an hour and 15 minutes compared to the estimation I made of 1 hour. I spent some time in Slack clearing up some confusion I had with the wording of some of the prompts.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I feel pretty good about where I stand on conditionals, but further repetition always helps to really cement my understanding of the concepts. At this point in time I don't feel it's necessary to make extra time to practice conditionals. I expect to be putting these things into practice in future projects. 
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I don't have any questions after completing this assignment, but if I do have a question I will be sure to utilize the necessary Slack channels in an effort to find an answer.
